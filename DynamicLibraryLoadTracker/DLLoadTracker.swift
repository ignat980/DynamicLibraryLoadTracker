             += forcefully creates an unwrapped pointer after calling .advance() on itself, so it uses the size of the struct that the pointer is typed to when performing this operation. It's just a nice coincidence that load_command is exactly 8 bytes and cmdsize will always be a multiple of 8 so that I can use this shorthand. It is also possible to use this shorthand for UnsafeRawPointer types, since .advance() goes by bytes and no division would be required.
             The more 'proper' way to do this would be to construct a new pointer like this:
             lc_cursor = UnsafePointer<load_command>(bitPattern: lc_cursor.hashValue + Int(lc_cursor.pointee.cmdsize))
